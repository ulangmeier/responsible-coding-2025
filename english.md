# Responsible Coding 2025  
## A Code of Conduct for Software Development in the Age of AI  
By Urs Langmeier

---

### Preamble

We are at a turning point. AI is transforming the way we write code, build systems, and make decisions. But with great power comes great responsibility.

This Code of Conduct is meant to serve as an ethical and practical guide to ensure that software development remains sustainable, responsible, and structurally sound in the face of AI-driven acceleration.

---

### 1. Understand Before You Use

Do not integrate code you don’t understand. No snippet, AI result, or forum answer should enter a production system unless the logic, purpose, and side effects are fully understood.

> **Example:** A developer accepts an AI-generated database migration that quietly removes NOT NULL constraints. This leads to undetected data corruption in production.

---

### 2. AI Is a Copilot, Not an Autopilot

AI is a tool, not a replacement for reasoning. Every suggestion must be reviewed, simplified, and adapted to the system. Responsibility remains human.

---

### 3. Structure Beats Speed

Code quality is not measured by how fast it’s written, but by clarity, maintainability, testability, and system fit.

---

### 4. Comments Explain “Why,” Not Just “What”

Documentation should reveal reasoning, use cases, exceptions, and purpose – not just what line 42 does.

---

### 5. No Debugging Without a Debugger

Bugs must be reproduced, isolated, and debugged properly – not guessed through endless prompting.

> **Example:** A bug is "fixed" over days of prompting instead of using a debugger. The result: new bugs and untested regressions.

---

### 6. All Code Is System Code

There is no “temporary” or “non-critical” code. Everything that ships affects the system’s integrity.

---

### 7. Architecture Is Not Optional

We think in systems, not tasks. Each feature or fix must integrate with or deliberately evolve the architecture.

---

### 8. We Work With Clarity, Not Guessing

When assumptions are made, they are declared. When uncertainty exists, it is acknowledged. Nothing is faked.

---

### 9. Treat AI Code Like Third-Party Code

Review it. Question it. Refactor it. Just because it “works” doesn’t mean it belongs.

---

### 10. We Cultivate Technical Conscience

Every developer is responsible not just for code, but for its effects – on users, teams, products, and society.
