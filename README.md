# Responsible Coding 2025

**A Code of Conduct for Software Development in the Age of AI**  
**By Urs Langmeier, Founder of Langmeier Backup**

## 🌐 Overview

This document is a call to action.  
AI tools are changing how we write code, but they also introduce new risks: loss of understanding, bloated code, architectural shortcuts, and fragile systems.

This Code of Conduct offers a set of principles to ensure that software remains clear, maintainable, ethical, and resilient – even in an era of automation and acceleration.

## 📜 The Manifesto

- **1. Understand before you use**  
  Never integrate code you don't understand – not from AI, not from Stack Overflow.

- **2. AI is a copilot, not an autopilot**  
  AI can assist, but decisions and responsibility remain human.

- **3. Structure beats speed**  
  Fast code is nothing without system design, clarity, and testability.

- **4. Comments explain “why”, not “what”**  
  Documentation should reflect intention and logic, not repeat the code.

- **5. No debugging without a debugger**  
  Bugs must be isolated, reproduced, and analyzed – not guessed.

- **6. All code is system code**  
  There is no "temporary" code. Everything affects the system.

- **7. Architecture is not optional**  
  Every feature must fit the system – or evolve it properly.

- **8. Work with clarity, not assumptions**  
  Explicit uncertainty is better than silent guesswork.

- **9. Treat AI code like third-party code**  
  Review, refactor, and contextualize before merging.

- **10. Cultivate technical conscience**  
  We are responsible not only for what we build, but what it causes.
